Update: 2025
Changing to public visibility.
This is my work underpinning my PhD thesis and three 1st author papers. There is much here that I would now do differently.

Original Readme:
This is the main directory, all scripts and notebooks in subdirectories should add this folder from their path and work down. STEEL is run simply by running python STEEL.py the input parameters are set at the bottom of the STEEL script. 

Future work here inclues making a runfile in which running parameters are set.
