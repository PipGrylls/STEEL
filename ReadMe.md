## This is the refacotring branch I am useing at the end of my PhD. This code will likely not work whilst I correct varible names and update code to a better standard. For an up to date working branch go to PipGrylls.


This is the main directory, all scripts and notebooks in subdirectories should add this folder from their path and work down. STEEL is run simply by running python STEEL.py the input parameters are set at the bottom of the STEEL script. 

Future work here inclues making a runfile in which running parameters are set.
