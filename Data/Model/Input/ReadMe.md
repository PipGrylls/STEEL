This folder contain the precalculated data input to STEEL. 
Files include central halo mass tracks and subhalo accretion histories that STEEL generates and then uses as input, havign the precalculated files in here speeds the program up significantly as it removes the need to run the statictical halo merger history generation each time STEEL is run.

Future work here includes making a file strucutre that supports new cosmologies and/or dark matter models (e.g Warm Dark Matter) such that STEEL saves appropriate statistical dark matter merging histories to the correct locations.
